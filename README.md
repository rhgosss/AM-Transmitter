# AM-Transmitter

This repository documents the steps that my colleague Leonidas Georgiou and I followed in order to analyze an AM transmitter.

We present our entire thought process, the methodology we followed, and the decisions we made along the way. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive guide to help future students or researchers in NTUA Labs working on AM receivers.

Until now, the common approach in the lab was to try and receive a signal from a nearby AM radio station. However, this method proved unreliable and inconsistent. Our implementation of a custom AM transmitter aims to offer a more stable and controllable solution for lab experiments and demonstrations.
